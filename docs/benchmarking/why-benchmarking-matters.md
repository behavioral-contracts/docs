# Why Benchmarking Matters

:::info Coming Soon
Complete benchmarking guide is under construction.
:::

## Quick Summary

Behavioral contracts aim for:

- **High Precision** - 95%+ of violations are real issues
- **Low False Positives** - Minimize noise
- **Comprehensive Coverage** - Catch important patterns

## Measuring Quality

We measure contract quality by:

1. **Precision** - % of reported violations that are real issues
2. **Recall** - % of real issues that we catch
3. **False Positive Rate** - % of violations that are false alarms

## Real-World Testing

Contracts are tested against real open-source projects to ensure accuracy.

## More Details Coming Soon

Full benchmarking methodology, results, and comparison to other tools coming soon!
